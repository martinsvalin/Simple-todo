Simple-todo is a teaching aid
=============================

I use this app to teach Ruby-on-Rails to beginners. The scope is small, and I know it well enough to live code it. While coding, I discuss the different parts of Rails. I touch on:

-  Creating an app, Bundler, Gems
-  Rails scaffolding, MVC and REST in general
-  Models (adding validations to Task)
-  Controllers (changing the flow of redirects in TasksController)
-  Views (tweaking layout, removing some scaffolded links)
-  Helpers (displaying a boolean value in a nicer way)
-  Assets, SCSS (adding some color to the page, using Twitter's Bootstrap)
-  Routes, REST (setting up a new action)
-  Coffeescript (adding simple sorting with listjs)
-  Rails API (using built-in helpers to point out the wealth of stuff in Rails)
-  Heroku deployment

I will be adding:

-  Acceptance testing with Capybara
-  Unit testing with Rspec
-  Something to the README
-  Adding something completely different

The master branch is tagged at appropriate places, to allow me to recover from the embarrassement of drawing a blank in the middle of coding. I create a local branch before class and clear it out entirely (except for .rvmrc)
